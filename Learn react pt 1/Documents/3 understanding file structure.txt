Understanding the Folder Structure in a Vite React Project 🚀  

1️⃣ `node_modules/`  
   - This folder contains all the dependencies and packages installed via `npm`.  
   - It is automatically generated when you run `npm install`.  
   - You should not modify this folder manually.  
   - It is ignored in Git (thanks to `.gitignore`).  

2️⃣ `public/`  
   - This folder contains static assets like images, icons, and fonts.  
   - Any file placed here is directly accessible in the browser (e.g., `/logo.png`).  
   - Unlike `src/`, files in `public/` are not processed by Vite—they remain unchanged.  

3️⃣ `src/`  
   - This is the main folder where all React components and logic reside.  
   - By default, it includes:  
     - `App.css` → The styling file for `App.jsx`.  
     - `App.jsx` → The main component of your React app.  
     - `index.css` → Global styles for the entire application.  
     - `main.jsx` → The entry point where React renders the `App` component into the DOM.  

This structure ensures that your project remains organized, modular, and scalable! 🚀🔥

1️⃣ App.css (Component-Specific Styles) 🎨

📌 What is it?
App.css is a CSS file that contains styling specifically for the App.jsx component.
It defines how elements inside App.jsx should look, such as fonts, colors, layouts, etc.

📌 Why is it used?
It helps keep styles separate from the component logic.
It makes the App.jsx component look visually appealing.
You can modify or replace it with a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, SCSS, or Styled Components for more customization.

2️⃣ App.jsx (Main Component) ⚛️

📌 What is it?
App.jsx is a React component that serves as the root component of your application.
It is the starting point where you define and organize your UI elements.

📌 Why is it used?
It acts as a container for all other components in the app.
You can import and use multiple components inside it (e.g., Navbar, Footer, Cards).
It makes React apps modular and easy to manage.

3️⃣ index.css (Global Styles) 🎨

📌 What is it?
index.css is a global CSS file that applies styles across the entire application.
Unlike App.css, which styles only App.jsx, index.css affects all components.

📌 Why is it used?
It sets default styles like font-family, background colors, margins, paddings, etc.
It ensures consistent design throughout the app.

4️⃣ main.jsx (Entry Point) 🚀

📌 What is it?
main.jsx is the entry file where React renders your app inside the actual HTML page (index.html).
It imports App.jsx and tells React where to display the UI inside the webpage.

📌 Why is it used?
It initializes the React app and connects it to the HTML file.
It enables React’s virtual DOM rendering.
It ensures that all components in App.jsx and other files get displayed properly in the browser.
